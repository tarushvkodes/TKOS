# TKOS Development Project Plan

This document serves as a comprehensive project plan for building TKOS—a custom operating system from scratch. It is structured into phases that cover all key components of OS development—from initial setup to advanced features. Use this as a roadmap to guide your work and as context for GitHub Copilot.

---

## Phase 1: Fundamentals & Environment Setup

### Objectives
- Gain a solid understanding of operating system concepts (process management, memory management, file systems, device drivers, interrupts).
- Set up the development environment with the necessary toolchain for building TKOS.

### Tasks
- **Research & Learning:**  
  - Study OS concepts using resources such as the [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org) and introductory OS development tutorials.
- **Language & Tools:**  
  - Choose a programming language (C/C++ or Rust recommended) for developing TKOS.
  - Install a cross-compiler (GCC/Clang) and an assembler (e.g., NASM).
  - Set up an emulator (QEMU or Bochs) for testing TKOS.
- **Project Structure:**  
  - Create a directory layout:
    ```
    /TKOS
      /bootloader
      /kernel
      /drivers
      /libs
      /docs
    ```

## Phase 2: Bootloader Development

### Objectives
- Develop a bootloader that initializes hardware and loads the TKOS kernel.

### Tasks
- Write a minimal bootloader in assembly to:
  - Transition the CPU from real mode (or UEFI mode) to protected/long mode.
  - Load the TKOS kernel binary from disk.
- Optionally integrate GRUB as an alternative boot manager.
- Validate bootloader functionality using an emulator.

---

## Phase 3: Minimal Kernel Implementation

### Objectives
- Create a simple TKOS kernel that confirms successful booting.

### Tasks
- **Kernel Entry Point:**  
  - Write a “Hello, TKOS!” kernel in your chosen language.
- **Basic I/O:**  
  - Set up VGA text mode or a similar display method to output the message and other TKOS-specific debug information.
- **Integration:**  
  - Ensure the bootloader correctly hands over control to the TKOS kernel.
- **Testing:**  
  - Use an emulator to verify that the TKOS kernel initializes and displays the message.

---

## Phase 4: Interrupt Handling & Driver Integration

### Objectives
- Implement basic hardware interrupt handling and drivers for TKOS.

### Tasks
- **Interrupts:**  
  - Set up the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT).
  - Write basic Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) for events (e.g., timer, keyboard).
- **Drivers:**  
  - Develop simple drivers for essential hardware like keyboard and screen handling.
- **Validation:**  
  - Test interrupt handling through simulated hardware events in the emulator.

---

## Phase 5: Memory Management

### Objectives
- Develop memory allocation and protection mechanisms for TKOS.

### Tasks
- **Memory Allocation:**  
  - Implement a simple bump allocator.
- **Advanced Memory Management:**  
  - Set up paging and segmentation.
  - Build an interface to manage memory protection and allocation.
- **Testing:**  
  - Validate memory operations via controlled tests in the emulator.

---

## Phase 6: System Call Interface

### Objectives
- Enable user applications to interact with the TKOS kernel.

### Tasks
- **API Definition:**  
  - Define a set of system calls (e.g., for file I/O, process management) tailored for TKOS.
- **Kernel Implementation:**  
  - Develop system call handlers and secure user/kernel mode transitions.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Document each system call’s functionality and usage for TKOS.

---

## Phase 7: File System Integration

### Objectives
- Create or integrate a basic file system for data storage in TKOS.

### Tasks
- **Design & Implementation:**  
  - Develop a simple file system, or integrate an existing minimal one, with TKOS-specific adaptations.
  - Implement basic operations: reading, writing, and directory management.
- **Testing:**  
  - Use disk images to simulate file system interactions on TKOS.

---

## Phase 8: User Interface & Shell Development

### Objectives
- Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction with TKOS.

### Tasks
- **Shell Development:**  
  - Write a basic command-line shell that interprets user commands.
  - Configure the command prompt to display as `TKOS>` (or a variant) to reinforce the OS branding.
- **Utility Programs:**  
  - Create initial utilities (e.g., file browser, text editor) as proofs of concept.
- **Integration:**  
  - Connect the shell with the system call interface to execute commands.

---

## Phase 9: Testing, Debugging & Iteration

### Objectives
- Ensure stability and performance through continuous testing and improvements in TKOS.

### Tasks
- **Testing:**  
  - Use an emulator (like QEMU) to test TKOS thoroughly.
  - Set up debugging tools (e.g., GDB configured for kernel debugging).
- **Iteration:**  
  - Continuously refine code based on test results.
  - Maintain detailed documentation of changes and known issues.

---

## Phase 10: Expansion & Optimization

### Objectives
- Enhance functionality, performance, and security in TKOS.

### Tasks
- **Advanced Features:**  
  - Implement multitasking and process scheduling.
  - Enhance security measures and user permission management.
- **Driver Enhancement:**  
  - Develop additional drivers (graphics, networking) for TKOS.
- **Optimization:**  
  - Refactor and optimize code for better performance.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Update documentation with new features and architectural changes.

---

## Final Deliverables

- A fully operational OS named TKOS with:
  - A bootloader and kernel that display “Hello, TKOS!” upon startup.
  - Basic I/O and interrupt handling.
  - Memory management and a robust system call interface.
  - A simple file system and command-line shell with the `TKOS>` prompt.
- Comprehensive documentation covering:
  - Project architecture.
  - Codebase details.
  - Testing procedures and known issues.
- A set of utility programs demonstrating TKOS capabilities.
